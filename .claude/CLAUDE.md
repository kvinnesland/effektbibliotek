# CLAUDE.md — AI Operating Model

> This file is read automatically by Claude Code at session start.
> It defines how Claude must behave in this repository.

## Project Initialization — First Run Only

When Claude Code is opened in this project for the first time, check all files in `sessions/` for the placeholder `YYYY-MM-DD`.

If the placeholder is found, replace every occurrence with today's actual date before doing anything else.

Files to check:
- `sessions/CURRENT-STATE.md`
- `sessions/IMPLEMENTATION-LEDGER.md`
- `sessions/OPEN-ISSUES.md`
- `sessions/DECISIONS.md`
- `sessions/ARCHITECTURE-STATE.md`

How to detect first run: if `sessions/CURRENT-STATE.md` contains `YYYY-MM-DD`, this is an uninitialized project. Replace all placeholders, save the files, then proceed with normal session startup.

## Session Startup — Required Steps

Before ANY implementation work, Claude MUST:

1. Read `sessions/CURRENT-STATE.md`
2. Read `sessions/OPEN-ISSUES.md`
3. Read all active change requests in `/change-requests`
4. Read impacted specs in `/specs`
5. Validate architecture consistency against `sessions/ARCHITECTURE-STATE.md`
6. If `CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root, read it
7. Produce an explicit implementation plan and present it before proceeding

If any of these files are missing or incomplete, stop and flag it.

## Session Shutdown — Required Steps

At the end of EVERY session, Claude MUST:

1. Update `sessions/CURRENT-STATE.md`
2. Append completed work to `sessions/IMPLEMENTATION-LEDGER.md`
3. Update `sessions/OPEN-ISSUES.md`
4. Document architectural decisions in `sessions/DECISIONS.md`
5. Document unfinished work and blockers
6. Document risks introduced
7. Document recommended next actions

---

## Forbidden Behavior

Claude MUST NEVER:

- Implement undocumented changes (no CR = no change)
- Violate module boundaries defined in `specs/architecture.md`
- Bypass validation scripts in `/validation`
- Skip review checklists in `/reviews`
- Duplicate abstractions that already exist
- Silently change architecture
- Refactor unrelated systems during feature work

---

## Required Behavior

Claude MUST ALWAYS:

- Maintain full traceability (CR → spec → code → test)
- Update orchestration files at session end
- Add tests for every new behavior
- Document risks and assumptions explicitly
- Preserve modular boundaries
- Reference the active CR in every commit message

## Agent Roles

| Task | Agent file |
|---|---|
| Architecture decisions | `.claude/agents/architect.md` |
| API / backend work | `.claude/agents/backend.md` |
| UI / frontend work | `.claude/agents/frontend.md` |
| Code review | `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` |
| Security review | `.claude/agents/security.md` |
| Testing / QA | `.claude/agents/qa.md` |

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/start-session` | Load state, identify blockers, generate plan |
| `/end-session` | Summarize work, update all orchestration files |
| `/create-cr` | Create a new change request with impact analysis |
| `/review` | Run full review checklist |
| `/implement` | Begin implementation from an approved CR |

---

## Architecture Principles

1. Maintainability
2. Explicitness — no implicit behavior
3. Traceability — every change has a paper trail
4. Modularity — clear boundaries between layers
5. Deterministic workflows — same input = same process
6. Low architectural drift
7. Safe refactoring
8. Long-term AI collaboration
