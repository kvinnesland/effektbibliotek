## Architectural Decisions

These are hard-to-reverse, structurally significant decisions worth preserving for future readers.
Only add an entry when all three are true:

2. Surprising without context — a future reader would wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. Result of a real trade-off — genuine alternatives existed
